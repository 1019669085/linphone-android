			   LINPHONE for ANDROID
			****************************

To build liblinphone for Android, you must:
1) download the Android ndk (>=r5c) from google.
2) install the autotools: autoconf, automake, aclocal, libtoolize pkgconfig
3) run the ./prepare_sources.sh script in the top level directory. This will download iLBC source files and convert some assembly files in VP8 project.

	$ ./prepare_sources.sh

4) finally from directory linphone-android, just execute command:
	$ ${my google ndk directory}/ndk-build

Some options can be passed to ndk-build, like "ndk-build SOME_OPTION=SOME_VALUE"

Option Name     |     Possible values
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD_X264            0 (don't build x264) or 1 (build x264)
BUILD_AMR             0 (don't build amr codec), light (try to use amr codec from android), full (build your own amr codec)
BUILD_GPLV3_ZRTP      0 (don't support ZRTP), 1 (support ZRTP and make the whole program GPLv3)
BUILD_SILK            0 (don't build silk plugin), 1 (build silk) [silk is Skype nonfree patented audio codec]
BUILD_TUNNEL          0 (don't build tunnel), 1 (build tunnel) [requires a tunnel implementation in submodules/linphone/tunnel]

In order to use ZRTP you also need to define the media_encryption property to
"zrtp" in the sip section of linphonerc file.
