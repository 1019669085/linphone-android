			   LINPHONE for ANDROID
			****************************

To build liblinphone for Android, you must:
0) download the Android sdk with platform-tools >= 13, tools >= 20 (20.0.3 for linux) and sdk platform >= 16, then add both 'tools' and 'platform-tools' folders in your path.
1) download the Android ndk (>=r5c) from google and add it to your path.
2) install the autotools: autoconf, automake, aclocal, libtoolize pkgconfig
2bis) on some 64 bits systems you'll need the ia32-libs package
3) run the Makefile script in the top level directory. This will download iLBC source files and convert some assembly files in VP8 project.
	$ make

To create an apk with a different package name, you need to edit the custom_rules.xml file:
1) look for the property named "linphone.package.name" and change it value accordingly
2) run again the Makefile script. You can only regenerate the apk if you already built it before.
	$ make install-apk

Some options can be passed to ndk-build, like "ndk-build SOME_OPTION=SOME_VALUE". Put them into the Makefile script, under the generate-libs target

Option Name     |     Possible values                                                                                                   | Default value 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD_X264            0 (don't build x264) or 1 (build x264)										
BUILD_AMRNB           0 (don't build amrnb codec), light (try to use amrnb codec from android), full (build your own amrnb codec)       |     light
BUILD_AMRWB           0 (don't build amrwb codec), 1 (build your own amrwb codec)                                                       |     1
BUILD_GPLV3_ZRTP      0 (don't support ZRTP), 1 (support ZRTP and make the whole program GPLv3)
BUILD_SILK            0 (don't build silk plugin), 1 (build silk) [silk is Skype nonfree patented audio codec]
BUILD_G729            0 (don't build g729 plugin), 1 (build g729) [g729 is nonfree patented audio codec, contact Sipro lab for more details]
BUILD_TUNNEL          0 (don't build tunnel), 1 (build tunnel) [requires a tunnel implementation in submodules/linphone/tunnel]

In order to use ZRTP you also need to define the media_encryption property to
"zrtp" in the sip section of linphonerc file.
